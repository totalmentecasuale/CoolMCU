# CoolMCU
Personal project for the Internet of Things course @ Politecnico di Milano, A.Y 2019/2020

## Project concept

Use a ESP8266 WiFi board to:

* Read the temperature and humidity values in a room
* Send these values to Thingspeak for easy real-time visualization
* Publish these values on a dedicated MQTT topic
* Subscribe to specific MQTT topics for remote control
* Control the AC present in the room via an IR LED and unit-specific IR codes.
